# Tesla's-revenge
This game is based on the historical "war" between Tesla and Edison. Tesla sent a hero to find his documents which have been stolen by Edison in time. Edison's labs are in space, and now the hero has to fight the space enemies created by Edison. The hero can win different advandages for the upcoming levels if he has basic knowledge in physics by solving different quiz. For example, if he solves the quiz after the first level, he would receive the "Tesla Wizzard Card" which can be used on the enemies and the enemie will be hit by a bolt.
